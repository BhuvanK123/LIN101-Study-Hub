# LIN101 Study Hub

This project is a personal initiative I began while taking **LIN101: Introduction to Linguistics**. As I progressed through the course, I found that many online resources were either too generalized, too technical, or didnâ€™t align well with the structure and terminology used in our curriculum. To bridge that gap, I decided to build a study tool tailored specifically to LIN101. This is something modular, interactive, and designed to support both my own learning and that of others who might benefit from a more focused resource.

The LIN101 Study Hub is a Flutter-based web application that organizes key topics in linguistics into accessible modules, starting with Phonetics. Itâ€™s designed to grow over time, with features that support active recall, self-testing, and visual learning.
